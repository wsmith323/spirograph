## Make `AGENTS.md` Repo-Location Agnostic

### Summary
Update `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md` to remove machine-specific absolute paths and standardize on repo-relative references so the guide works from any clone location.

### Scope
1. Edit only `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md`.
2. Replace all absolute file paths that start with `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/` with repo-relative paths.
3. Keep environment/tooling requirements intact (no behavior/policy changes beyond path portability).

### Planned Edits
1. In “Repo Snapshot”, change `see /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/pyproject.toml` to `see pyproject.toml`.
2. In “Key Files”, convert each absolute path to repo-relative:
   1. `spirograph/main.py`
   2. `spirograph/orchestration.py`
   3. `spirograph/generation/circular_generator.py`
   4. `spirograph/rendering/builder.py`
   5. `spirograph/rendering/turtle_renderer.py`
   6. `docs/architecture/architecture_v1.md`
3. In “Coding Rules”, change Ruff config reference to `pyproject.toml` (repo-relative).
4. Add one short rule in the document (near Purpose or Coding Rules): “All file references in this guide are repo-relative unless explicitly noted.”
5. Leave `VIRTUAL_ENV=/path/to/venv ./scripts/test ...` unchanged, because it is already location-agnostic.

### Public APIs / Interfaces / Types
No code APIs, CLI interfaces, schemas, or Python types change. This is documentation-only.

### Validation and Checks
1. Run a search in `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md` to confirm there are no remaining `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/` references.
2. Quick readability pass to verify each referenced path is valid relative to repo root.
3. Optional consistency check: ensure any future file references added in this file follow the same relative-path rule.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md` contains zero absolute repo-root paths.
2. All referenced files in the guide are resolvable from repo root as written.
3. Existing testing guidance and policy intent remain unchanged.

### Risks / Regression Potential
1. Low risk: documentation-only change.
2. Minor risk: typo in relative path; mitigated by path existence check.

### Assumptions and Defaults
1. Assumption: portability goal applies to repo paths in `AGENTS.md`, not historical absolute paths in archived plan docs.
2. Default: use plain repo-relative paths instead of introducing `REPO_ROOT` placeholders.
3. Default: do not alter policy that tests must run with explicit `VIRTUAL_ENV`.
