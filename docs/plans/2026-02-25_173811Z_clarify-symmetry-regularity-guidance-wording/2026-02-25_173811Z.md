# Clarify Symmetry/Regularity Guidance Wording (Console UI)

## Summary

Refine the `Curve guidance` text so the existing simple categorical value
(`strong` / `moderate` / `weak`) remains, but its meaning is clear to users.

This is a wording-only UI change:
- Rename the ambiguous `Symmetry feel` line to
  `Perceived symmetry while drawing`
- Remove `(heuristic)` suffixes from guidance output lines
- Add a concise explanatory note clarifying that the value describes apparent
  repeat clarity during tracing, not whether the curve closes

No math, scoring thresholds, or generator/rendering behavior changes.

## Goals and Success Criteria

- Eliminate confusion between mathematical closure/periodicity and the UI’s
  appearance-oriented “symmetry” value.
- Preserve compact output and current simple categorical values.
- Keep the current density/symmetry scoring logic unchanged.
- Make the guidance understandable without requiring prior explanation.

Success criteria:
- A user can read the guidance block and understand that:
  - the curve can still be closed/periodic even when the value is `weak`
  - the label refers to perceived structure while tracing/drawing
- Existing tests remain green after updating output expectations.

## In Scope

- `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/console_ui/guidance.py`
- `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/tests/spirograph/console_ui/test_guidance.py`

## Out of Scope

- Any changes to symmetry/density formulas, thresholds, or classifications
- Generator math or closure semantics
- Console menu/prompt flow changes
- Renderer behavior changes

## Public APIs / Interfaces / Types

- No public API/type changes.
- `describe_curve(request)` remains the same callable and keeps the same internal
  scoring logic.
- Output text changes only.

## Exact Output Changes (Decision Complete)

## 1. Rename the symmetry line label

Current:
- `Symmetry feel: <value> (heuristic)`

New:
- `Perceived symmetry while drawing: <value>`

Rationale:
- Explicitly frames the value as visual/perceptual
- Ties it to the tracing process
- Avoids implying mathematical symmetry or closure validity

## 2. Remove `(heuristic)` suffix text from guidance lines

Current lines with suffixes:
- `Symmetry feel: ... (heuristic)`
- `Visual density estimate: ... (heuristic)`

New lines:
- `Perceived symmetry while drawing: <value>`
- `Visual density estimate: <value>`

Rationale:
- User requested removal; suffix adds noise once wording is clarified.

## 3. Add a fixed clarification note in the `Curve guidance` block

Add one short line (after the density line and before `Notes:`) clarifying context:

Recommended exact wording:
- `Interpretation: This describes how clearly the repeating structure is perceived while tracing, not whether the curve closes.`

Placement:
- In `describe_curve()` output, directly before the existing `Notes:` line.

Rationale:
- Keeps compact categorical value
- Explains the context once
- Avoids overloading the label itself

## 4. Keep everything else unchanged

Do not change:
- Density label values (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very High`)
- Symmetry category values (`strong`, `moderate`, `weak`)
- Any scoring/classification logic
- Notes-generation logic
- Manual-entry guidance text (this request is specifically about interpreting the
  post-selection line)

## Implementation Steps

1. Update `describe_curve()` output strings in
   `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/console_ui/guidance.py`:
   - rename `Symmetry feel` label
   - remove `(heuristic)` suffixes
   - add the fixed `Interpretation:` line
2. Update output-smoke assertions in
   `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/tests/spirograph/console_ui/test_guidance.py`
   to match the new label and ensure the clarification line is present
3. Run targeted tests for guidance output
4. Run full test suite
5. Stage the changes in git (`git add ...`)
6. Run the `capture-last-plan` skill to persist this plan

## Test Cases and Scenarios

## Automated tests (pytest)

Update `tests/spirograph/console_ui/test_guidance.py` output-smoke test(s) to
assert:
- `Perceived symmetry while drawing` is present
- `Visual density estimate` is present
- `Interpretation:` is present
- `Symmetry feel` is not present
- `approx lobes` is not present

Keep all existing helper/metrics tests unchanged.

## Manual Scenarios (Console UI)

- Generate a curve with `Perceived symmetry while drawing: weak` and confirm the
  new `Interpretation:` line makes it clear this is about visual tracing
  appearance, not closure.
- Verify the guidance block still reads compactly and the note does not feel too
  verbose.

## Validation Commands (Plan Defaults)

- Targeted:
  - `VIRTUAL_ENV=~/work/virtualenvs/spirograph ./scripts/test tests/spirograph/console_ui/test_guidance.py -q`
- Full suite:
  - `VIRTUAL_ENV=~/work/virtualenvs/spirograph ./scripts/test -q`

## Risks / Regression Potential

- Very low risk (string/output wording only).
- Output-smoke tests may need minor updates if spacing/newline formatting
  changes.
- Removing `(heuristic)` slightly reduces explicit caveating, but the new label
  plus `Interpretation:` line provides better context.

## Assumptions and Defaults Chosen

- Keep the existing simple categorical values (`strong` / `moderate` / `weak`).
- Do not alter scoring logic in this pass.
- Remove `(heuristic)` from both symmetry and density output lines.
- Add exactly one clarifying interpretation line in the guidance block rather
  than expanding every line’s wording.
