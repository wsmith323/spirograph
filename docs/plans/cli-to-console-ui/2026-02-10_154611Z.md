## Breaking Rename Plan: Remove `cli` Identifiers and Move to `console_ui`

### Summary
Execute a clean breaking rename in code and docs so `CLI`/`cli` is removed from project terminology and internal identifiers. No compatibility shims will be added.  
Primary result: `spirograph/cli` becomes `spirograph/console_ui`, and `CliSessionState` is renamed to a `console_ui`-based type.

### Scope
In scope:
- `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/cli/*` -> `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/console_ui/*`
- `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/main.py` imports and type names
- Active docs:
  - `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/README.md`
  - `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/docs/architecture/architecture_v1.md`
  - `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md`

Out of scope:
- Archived files under `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/docs/plans/**`
- Backward-compat re-export shims

### Naming Decisions (Locked)
1. Package path:
- `spirograph.cli` -> `spirograph.console_ui`

2. Session type:
- `CliSessionState` -> `ConsoleUiSessionState`

3. User-facing term:
- Canonical narrative term: `console UI`
- Keep `CLI` only when explicitly describing command invocation syntax (if needed)

### Implementation Steps
1. Rename directory and preserve module boundaries:
- Move `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/cli` to `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/console_ui`
- Keep same module files (`guidance.py`, `prompts.py`, `random.py`, `session.py`, `types.py`, `__init__.py`) unless minimal edits are needed for naming.

2. Rename session class:
- In `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/console_ui/session.py`, rename `CliSessionState` to `ConsoleUiSessionState`.

3. Update imports/usages:
- In `/Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph/main.py`:
  - `.cli.*` imports -> `.console_ui.*`
  - `CliSessionState` references -> `ConsoleUiSessionState`
- Run repo-wide replacement for `spirograph.cli` import paths in active files (excluding archived plans).

4. Update docs wording and paths:
- Replace narrative `CLI` references with `console UI` in scoped active docs.
- Replace literal path mentions `spirograph/cli/...` with `spirograph/console_ui/...` in active docs.

5. Do not add compatibility layer:
- No new `spirograph/cli` package.
- No deprecated aliases for old class names.

### Public Interface Impact
Breaking changes:
- Python import path break:
  - `from spirograph.cli...` no longer valid
  - New path: `from spirograph.console_ui...`
- Type rename break:
  - `CliSessionState` removed
  - Use `ConsoleUiSessionState`

Unchanged:
- Executable command `spirograph`
- Module entrypoint `python3 -m spirograph.main`
- Runtime behavior of generation/render pipeline (intent is nomenclature-only)

### Validation Plan
1. Rename completeness checks:
- `rg -n "\\bCliSessionState\\b|spirograph\\.cli|/cli/" /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/tests /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/README.md /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/docs/architecture/architecture_v1.md /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md`
- Expected: no matches in scoped active files.

2. New-name presence checks:
- `rg -n "ConsoleUiSessionState|spirograph\\.console_ui|console UI" /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/spirograph /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/README.md /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/docs/architecture/architecture_v1.md /Users/warren/work/projects/spirograph/AGENTS.md`
- Expected: new names present where appropriate.

3. Test/static checks (with required interpreter/venv contract):
- Use `/Users/warren/work/virtualenvs/spirograph/bin/python`
- Run project tests via required wrapper:
  - `VIRTUAL_ENV=/Users/warren/work/virtualenvs/spirograph ./scripts/test`
- If full suite is slow, at minimum run existing generation tests and import sanity.

4. Manual smoke checks (per AGENTS guidance):
- Launch program
- Run one random curve
- Run one manual curve
- Run one non-fixed color mode

### Risks and Regressions
1. External consumer breakage:
- Any external code importing `spirograph.cli.*` or `CliSessionState` will fail immediately.

2. Missed references:
- Stray string/path in active docs or code may cause inconsistency or import errors.

3. Rename tooling mistakes:
- File moves can leave stale imports if not validated with grep + test run.

### Assumptions and Defaults
- Clean breaking change is intentional and accepted.
- No migration window or deprecation policy is required.
- Archived plan docs are historical records and will not be rewritten.
- No behavior math/randomness semantics are intentionally changed.
