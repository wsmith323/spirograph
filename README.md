This project aims to create a feature-rich digital spirograph with functionality
far beyond that of the classic real-world spirograph kit.

- Stateless CLI
- Circular tracks
- Circular rollers
- Random curve parameters

## v1 and beyond

- Plugable architecture
- Non-circular tracks
- Non-circular rollers
- Non-centered curves
- Multiple curves in a single drawing
- Curve configuration persistence
- Additional graphical output options like SVG, JSON API for embedding in 
  websites, animated GIFs, video files, etc.
- GUI options: Stateful CLI, Desktop, and Web

## v1.0 (MVP)
