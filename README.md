# Digital Spirograph

Currently a work in progress, this project aims to create a feature rich 
digital spirograph with functionality far beyond that of the classic 
spirograph kit.

## The initial version will:
- Have a command line interface for configuring and running the spirograph.
- Support circular tracks
- Support circular rollers
- Use Python Turtle Graphics to draw the spirograph curves.

## Future versions may include:
- Non-circular tracks
- Non-circular rollers
- Multiple curves in a single spirograph
- Curve configuration persistence
- Additional graphical output options like SVG, JSON API for embedding in 
  websites, animated GIFs, video files, etc.
- Web-based GUI
